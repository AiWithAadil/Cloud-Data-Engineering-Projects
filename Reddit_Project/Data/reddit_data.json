For example a true positive is worth $1000, a false positive -$500 and the other cells $0. \n\nYou then optimise the threshold based on maximum benefit using a cost-threshold curve.

I\u2019ve heard the pay is pretty good in sales engineering too.\nHowever, I was wondering if I didn\u2019t like it after a few months or years, would it be possible to come back to product or data science?

        "selftext": "A huge part of this job is working with stakeholders to take their grand ideas and make them a reality. Naturally, there's gonna be trial and error, dead ends, talking through different approaches, and that's all fine. That's not what I'm complaining about. \n\nThe problem is that these stakeholders are higher up in the company and they're just strapped for time. They don't think about the things they ask me to do until I'm actually in a meeting with them, then it turns into a lot of \"yeah let's do it this way, no actually that won't work, wait no it will disregard that just do it the first way\".... I'm sitting here with a pen and paper or onenote open trying to catch everything and I just simply can't. I've tried to  summarize at the end of meetings what the next steps are that we've settled on, and it's intended to be a yes/no question but it just ends up turning into another stream of consciousness info dump that leaves me with more questions than answers.\n\nOften times I run into simple questions as I'm working through a project. They're yes/no or not much more involved than that, but whenever I try to email or chat with a stakeholder they ALWAYS want to just meet and then what should've been a 30 second call ends up going past the hour mark, and I'm left with more questions than I started with and now I have to burn more time trying to make sense of the notes I just took. That's not even considering that 50% of the time when they get me on the call there's a \"oh by the way since you're here can you do this project as well\". \n\nThis has the effect of disincentivizing me from seeking guidance. Furthermore, I never actually get projects over the finish line because every time I pass off my results there's millions of changes and updates that I'm asked to do. I used to be a very proactive person in school and in more junior jobs, I used to get things done ahead of time. But not anymore, If I finish a project ahead of time they'll just scope creep it to death, vs if I just sit on it and pass it off right before the deadline, they'll be forced to accept that it's good enough and just take it. I'm also being disincentivized to work efficiently. \n\nThe biggest part of my job is stenography. I'm not even exaggerating. \n\nI know you guys are going to say it sounds like a culture problem, but it has been like this in the last 3 DS positions I've had at different companies. As I said, I think the root of the problem is that the stakeholders are strapped for time,  but in a world of \"streamlining headcount\", I don't really see that changing.\n\nIf this thread is popular, know I'm gonna get a bunch of people hijacking it ask for advice for getting into the field.

We may need to add in some complexity to solve different tasks, but most managers/bosses I've encountered have been terrified by any actual ML/mathematics.

Random Forest, cross-wavelets, transfer entropy, fractals analysis, chaos theory, Bayesian statistics? The thing that puzzle me most is that we know there is a lag between the plankton bloom and aerosols eventually forming in the atmosphere, it can take weeks for a bloom to trigger aerosols formation, so far many studies have just used lagged Pearson\u00b4s correlation, which I am not too happy with as correlation really isn\u00b4t reliable, would you know of any advanced methods to find out the optimal lag? What would be the best approach in your opinion?  \nI would really appreciate any ideas, so please don\u00b4t hesitate to write down yours and I\u00b4d be happy to debate it, have a nice Sunday, cheers :)",

        "selftext": "I want to extract CLIP embeddings from 40k videos at a certain frame rate. To do this there are three main things I need to do, which are to first read the video to extract frames, preprocess the frames using the CLIP Image processor and use CLIP itself to extract the embeddings. The first two operations are cpu heavy and the last one is gpu heavy.\n\nOne option to do this would be to use Spark with a cluster of T4 machines, with more cores and RAM, that reads a chunk of the video, preprocesses it and encodes it using CLIP. But if I was to do that sometimes the GPU would be idle and sometimes the CPU would not be used to it's full potential.\n\nWhat would be the best way to solve this issue? Note that if I was to split this into two tasks I would need to store the preprocessed video frames and that seems overkill because it be around 100 TB of storage (yeah, mp4 really compresses videos well). Is there a way to do this processing using two different kinds of machines on the same cluster? One that is CPU and RAM heavy and one that has a GPU?\n\nI'm sure this could be achieves with Kubernetes, but that seems overkill for this task. Is there an easy way to do this with Spark? Should this even be done with Spark? For context I am doing this in GCP and I really only have basic knowledge of Spark",
